## What is the compilation process?

A compiler is a program that translates human readable code to computer readable.

## What is the most important skill of a programmer?

The most important skill for a programmer is the ability to find solutions for issues.

## Why C# is a statically typed programming language?

Because it is checked at compile time if we use the correct types.

## Procedural Programming

Programming based on procedures named methods. It can lead to an antipattern named spaghetti code. 

Issues caused by procedural programming:

- Spaghetti code
- No way to control who can access methods
- No separation by levels of abstraction
- Changes in requirements are hard to implement
- Logic is not easily configurable

## Abstraction

Abstraction means that classes expose only essential data and methods and hide the underlying details.
